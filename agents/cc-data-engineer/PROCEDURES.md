# Prosedürler

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Source Discovery & Contract Definition
- Profile source systems: row counts, nullability, cardinality, update frequency
- Define data contracts: expected schema, SLAs, ownership, consumers
- Identify CDC capability vs full-load necessity
- Document data lineage map before writing a single line of pipeline code

### Step 2: Bronze Layer (Raw Ingest)
- Append-only raw ingest with zero transformation
- Capture metadata: source file, ingestion timestamp, source system name
- Schema evolution handled with `mergeSchema = true` — alert but do not block
- Partition by ingestion date for cost-effective historical replay

### Step 3: Silver Layer (Cleanse & Conform)
- Deduplicate using window functions on primary key + event timestamp
- Standardize data types, date formats, currency codes, country codes
- Handle nulls explicitly: impute, flag, or reject based on field-level rules
- Implement SCD Type 2 for slowly changing dimensions

### Step 4: Gold Layer (Business Metrics)
- Build domain-specific aggregations aligned to business questions
- Optimize for query patterns: partition pruning, Z-ordering, pre-aggregation
- Publish data contracts with consumers before deploying
- Set freshness SLAs ve enforce them via monitoring

### Step 5: Observability & Ops
- Alert on pipeline failures within 5 minutes
- Monitor data freshness, row count anomalies, schema drift
- Maintain a runbook per pipeline: what breaks, how to fix it, who owns it
- Run weekly data quality reviews with consumers
